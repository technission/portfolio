            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am very interested in growing my knowledge with web development and have thoroughly enjoyed what I have experienced already with both the Thinkful course and my previous experience at a vocational school during my high school years. I am interested in talking with my fellow peers on Slack and possibly working on some projects together as a group. If you have some ideas and would like help with any projects please feel free to contact me via the links below.</p>
                <p>When I am not continuing my knowledge of web development I enjoy many other things like:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Shooting Pool</li>
                <li>Spending time with my son</li>
                <li>Visiting with family and friends</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Working on many projects around the house</li>
                    </ul>
